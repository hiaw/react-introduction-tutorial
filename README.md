# Introduction to React

This repository has been created as an introduction to the main features of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) 
and [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router). It was created using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

All the code for this tutorial is in a repository which allows you to follow along coding by switching between branches. 
You can find the setup instructions in the [README here](https://github.com/justsayno/react-introduction-code).

After you installed the packages and run the app you can set your repository to the beginning with this command:

``` shell
git checkout step-0
```

Each step of the tutorial will have the git command that you need to see the code changes as you go along.
